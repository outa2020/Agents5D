This capstone project is an opportunity for you to apply what you've learned during the course week and submit it for evaluation.

The high level process for a capstone project consists of:

Selecting a track (and only one track) from one of the four options. This will scope the problem/use case for your project.
Example: Concierge Agents
Formulating a problem and solution pitch to which you will build your agent. This will hone the objective of your project.
Example: Writing blogs is too manual and time intensive. I will be building an Automated Blog Writer Agent to scale my blog production and blog quality.
Developing and publishing the code for your agent publicly.
Example: Publishing the agent code to GitHub or Kaggle Notebooks.
Being able to articulate the value of the agent by preparing a writeup.
Example: This agent reduced my blog writing process by 10 hours per week
For bonus points, publishing a video related to the project.
Submitting a writeup to this competition no later than December 1, 2025 11:59AM Pacific Time. Check out "How Do I Make A Submission section" below.
